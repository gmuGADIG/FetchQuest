Franklin: That farmer is as jolly as ever! I can definitely see it in the quality of his crops!
Michael: I heard about the drama that unfolded with the Elder. I knew something like this was bound to happen eventually…
"Mr SignPost": What do you mean that Alchemist isn’t as crazy as you think?! I bet their craziness is rubbing off on you!
Rupert: I’ve seen you with the Guard a lot. They actually seem like a pretty nice person! Overprotective, yes, but nice!
blue_brian: I know that I’m not the Librarian, but I’d like to thank you for helping them! I enjoyed the new reading material you fetched!
Franklin: It’s nice that you got the Survivalist to break out of their shell a little bit. Whenever I tried talking to them before, they just ran away!
