Franklin: It’s dangerous to go alone, boy! Be careful!
Michael: I’m wondering if I should jump into a big pile of the fungi… Maybe I’ll also get superpowers like the king!

Rupert: Back off, bub! My bite is worse than my bark! But, your bite is worse than mine… Heck, why am I trying to pick a fight with a dog?!
blue_brian: That's a funny looking stick you got there! I remember using sticks as swords when I was a kid…
Franklin: Hmph. Petty dogs. They ALWAYS need to have that SPECIFIC stick…
