Franklin: I think people give that Alchemist character too much credit. You just mix and match random stuff, and BAM! A cure for a specific disease just happens to pop up!
Michael: The Elder’s juicy gossip is the only thing keeping me running during these times. Always nice to hear about others’ misfortune!
"Mr SignPost": I could have sworn I saw the Blacksmith’s anvil look at me…
Rupert: I wish I could be as jolly as that farmer… There’s fungi getting into his crops, and he still is upgoing and cheery… 
blue_brian: If you see the Librarian, give me a bark! I have a book that is 24 weeks overdue and I’m too young to go to jail!
Franklin: I wonder if the Doctor is developing a cure for those infected with the fungus. Don’t want any more instances of our king…
