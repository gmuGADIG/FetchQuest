class_name TransitionScene extends Area2D

## Name of the scene to transition to, without the file path or extension.[br]
## e.g. to load [code]res://world/overworld.tscn[/code], just enter [code]overworld[/code][br][br]
## Note that the scene must be present in the worlds or test_scenes folder 
## (but it can be several folders deep within one of those).
## Avoid giving two scenes the same name or this will behave unpredictably.
@export var scene_name: String

## The entry point the player should entry the new scene from. [br]
## The scene's `EntryPoint` node should have a child of this name.
