	huntress: I’m so glad you stopped by. I was over by the traveling circus the other day with Reginald, and you would not believe the wonderful tunes we heard. Some days I just want to lay in a grassy field and enjoy the sweet melodies of nature. Now that I think about it, I haven’t seen Reginald since then. Would you look out for him? He usually enjoys listening to music in grassy fields. No wonder we get along so well.

	huntress: Hello Arthur. You caught me at a rough time. Every year when the heat reaches its peak, I try to collect some yellow flowers for my father’s grave. But with this corruption so bad, there aren’t enough flowers. It’s a blight on everything we hold dear.

	huntress: Well, if it isn’t my favorite dog. I bet you never expected to find me here. I was up in the village earlier, and I overheard the doctor talking about healing waters in the Miry Grove so I just had to come check it out for myself. Turns out he was wrong. Nothing special about this water except for the number of things living in it. Truly spectacular how life is found in even the most unexpected places
