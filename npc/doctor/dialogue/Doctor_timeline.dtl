Doctor: To think so much information can be gathered from just a couple samples of the fungi. We simply can’t stop here now can we?! This is just the beginning!
Doctor: Bah, the villagers think my research on the fungi is dangerous. They don’t know dangerous ‘til they’ve accidentally blown up half a research lab with unstable crystals and dark matter. This is child’s play.
Doctor: Whatever happens little adventurer, you come back unharmed alright? There’s more research to be done and I’ll need my best assistant on the job.
