# NOTE: This script applies to all enemies.
# To create a new enemy, create an inherited scene from the base enemy, then 
# replace the existing script with a new script extending `Enemy`.
#
# REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTING AN ENEMY:
# If you override _ready, _process, or _physics_process, you MUST call
# super._ready() (or super._process(delta), etc) in your overridden method.
#
# How to make a new enemy:
# For a base level enemy, the only thing that needs to be done is state switching. 
# If custom movement is desired, override the respective state's _process function
# (_process_roaming, _process_stunned, etc.)
# In order to change the behavior to switch between states, override the decide_state
# function, which is called every _process
#
# Each enemy should have a collision shape that has a radius associated with
# one of the navigation layers. That way the enemy navigation will work correctly.
# Right now, the only supported radius is associated with a square collision
# shape of size 96x96, or a circular shape with radius 60.
